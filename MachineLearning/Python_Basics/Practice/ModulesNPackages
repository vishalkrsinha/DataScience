#Tips...
#1. Python looks for libraries/packages in sys.path defined in 'sys' library
     #e.g. import sys
     #     sys.path
#2. There are a list of packages at different paths where python looks for a library. We can copy our python file there & can access it.
#3. How to install/add more packages on our system through PIP?
     #e.g. cmd prompt->Admin rights->pip install numpy
#4. We can work on Python through command prompt as well. 
    #Just write Python - it will come in Python mode. To get out of Python mode - Ctrl+Z+Enter
#5. To run a python file from command prompt: cmd->python abc.py
    

import sys
sys.path
